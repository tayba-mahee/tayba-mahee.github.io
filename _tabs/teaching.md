## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in creating an inclusive, engaging learning environment where students are active participants in their education. My approach emphasizes:

- **Conceptual Understanding**: Moving beyond memorization to deep comprehension
- **Active Learning**: In-class exercises, collaborative problem-solving, and hands-on practice
- **Student-Centered Design**: Adapting teaching methods to diverse learning styles and backgrounds
- **Formative Assessment**: Regular feedback opportunities to guide learning
- **Real-World Connections**: Linking theory to practical applications

## Professional Development

I continuously work to improve my teaching through:
- Participating in pedagogy workshops and conferences
- Incorporating evidence-based teaching practices
- Seeking and responding to student feedback
- Staying current with CS education research and best practices
